  /// When to call: When a new member is invited to a call, or a member accepts, rejects, exits, or a member response times out, all users on the current call invitation whose status is "Inviting," "Accepted," and "Received" receive the callback here. If the member is not online at the time of notification, the call is still ongoing when the login succeeds. The status changes of all members during the offline period will be sent to the user at one time.
